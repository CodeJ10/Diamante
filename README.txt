This project aims to revolutionize the real estate market by digitalizing property
 ownership through blockchain technology. By converting property papers into digital
tokens, each token represents a unique property and is initially owned by the seller.
Buyers can securely purchase these tokens using cryptocurrency, and upon completion
of the transaction, the ownership of the token—and therefore the property—transfers
seamlessly to the buyer. This system ensures a secure, transparent, and efficient
way to trade real estate, leveraging the immutability and decentralization of blockchain
to prevent fraud and streamline property transactions.
